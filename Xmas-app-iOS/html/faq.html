<h3 id="1">What is Christmas in the Park?</h3>
<p>Each year, the two-acre Plaza De Cesar Chavez is transformed into a holiday fantasy with over 40 musical and animated exhibits, glittering lights and the 60-foot Community Giving Tree. Some of the original displays housed in one of the largest exhibits, the Lima Train, include a melting snowman, caroling mice and elf woodcrafters.</p>
<p>We are a 501 (c3) non-profit organization that brings this free community event through sponsorships, donations, grants, and programs. Each summer, we host &#8220;Christmas in July&#8221;, a fundraiser under the stars and the brightly lit palm trees, where guests dine and dance in support of the event. Throughout the rest of the year, Santa and his elves work long and hard to clean, spruce and fix up the displays, work with companies to develop sponsorships, find grants, and raise the necessary dollars to bring this magical holiday experience to you every year.</p>

<h3 id="2">How much does it cost to go to Christmas in the Park?</h3>
<p>Absolutely nothing! It’s free to visit Christmas in the Park with your friends and families. Our mission is to bring you “A Gift of Joy and Magic”. It is expensive to produce Christmas in the Park every year and we ask you to visit our food court or to make a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=PNSZ7WHRJ333W">donation</a> to the program.
